    <h2>Why Envelope Collaboration Starts with Framing</h2>
<p>The best time to protect the building from water is while framing it. GQC coordinates WRB, flashing, and openings so the building sheds water as soon as possible. Our crews detail sill pans, head flashings, and transitions specified by the design team and verify they are compatible with the selected WRB and window system.</p>
<p>We push for early mockups that everyone can sign off on—GC, architect, envelope consultant, and manufacturer. Mockups clarify expectations and become the standard that inspectors use on the deck, cutting punch time later.</p>
<h2>Sequencing that Speeds Dry‑In</h2>
<p>We group scopes so that WRB tie‑ins follow closely behind framing completion. Where possible, windows are set by the same team that framed the opening, reducing handoff friction. This is not always feasible, but even coordinating rough‑opening verification with the window sub prevents costly returns and reseals.</p>
<p>Our field leadership maintains a rough‑opening matrix: every opening type, size, and hardware set tied to a detail and inspection point. That document eliminates guesswork and protects schedule.</p>
<h2>Quality Controls that Survive Weather and Time</h2>
<p>Moisture does not care about intent—it finds gaps. We train crews to watch for laps facing the wrong direction, missing end dams, and over‑driven fasteners. We also audit penetrations added by other trades and alert the GC so details get restored before sheathing is closed. Buildings that are protected early allow interiors to start sooner and reduce mold risk for the owner.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
