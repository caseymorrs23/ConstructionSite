# Stephenson & Montana Construction – Website Bundle

This is a ready-to-deploy 5-page construction company website inspired by the clarity of Montana Duct Supply and the showcase style of Stephenson Construction.

## Pages
- `index.html` – Home
- `about.html` – About
- `services.html` – Services
- `gallery.html` – Project Gallery
- `contact.html` – Contact (mailto action by default)

## Assets
- All styles in `assets/css/style.css`
- Small vanilla JS in `assets/js/app.js` (mobile menu + simple form validation)
- Placeholder images (SVG) in `assets/images/` including hero banners, service tiles, gallery, logo, and favicon.

## Customize
- Replace placeholders in `assets/images/` with your photos/logos.
- Update company info in the page headers (search for `Stephenson & Montana Construction`).
- Adjust colors in `:root` inside `assets/css/style.css`.
- Swap `mailto:` on `contact.html` to your form provider (e.g., Formspree or a backend endpoint).

## SEO
- Each page includes meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, and `Contractor` schema (`JSON-LD`).

## Deployment
- **GitHub Pages:** push to a repo and enable Pages (root).  
- **cPanel/Hosting:** upload the contents of the zip to `public_html`.  
- **Netlify/Vercel:** drag-and-drop the folder in their UI.
