    <h2>Clear Handoffs, Not Crowded Decks</h2>
<p>Trade stacking wastes time and increases risk. We work with the GC to define zones and dates when each trade owns a space. This allows framers to finish cleanly and the next trade to start without rework. Where overlaps are necessary, we publish a one‑page plan so everyone knows who is working where and when.</p>
<p>Daily five‑minute huddles align the plan and highlight material needs before they become blockers. This cadence reduces radio chatter and keeps leadership focused on forward progress.</p>
<h2>Material Flow and Housekeeping</h2>
<p>Clean decks are productive decks. We stage material by sequence, band pallets by floor, and return scraps to carts to avoid slip hazards. It’s not just housekeeping—orderly decks allow inspectors to see the work, which speeds approvals.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
