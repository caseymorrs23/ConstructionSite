    <h2>Why Schedule is the First Quality Metric</h2>
<p>On large multi-family projects the schedule is the first quality metric because it governs financing, owner turnover, and every downstream trade. Our framing plan is built around stable crew sizes, predictable handoffs, and a daily rhythm that keeps inspections flowing. We track units framed per day and elevation progress by grid so the GC can forecast with accuracy.</p>
<p>Schedule-driven production does not mean rushing. It means eliminating friction—clear staging paths, pre-built blocking bundles, and scopes that prevent trade stacking. This approach lowers safety exposure and actually improves craftsmanship because crews aren’t forced into stop‑start chaos.</p>
<h2>How We Build a Realistic CPM</h2>
<p>We start with baseline outputs informed by building height, shear density, truss complexity, and crane time. Those outputs convert into durations; durations become milestones. We then buffer weather-sensitive tasks and coordinate with envelope to prioritize dry‑in. The CPM we provide shows how framing, envelope, and windows converge to hand a dry building to MEPs weeks earlier.</p>
<p>During execution, superintendents do short daily huddles to confirm planned vs. actual. If a deck falls behind, we can flex to a recovery plan without blowing up the whole sequence. This is where production framing experience pays off: knowing which levers to pull without creating new constraints.</p>
<h2>Dashboards Owners Care About</h2>
<p>Owners want certainty. Our dashboards show delivered vs. planned framing components, inspection pass rates, and variance reasons. We keep the GC informed with photos and zone maps so stakeholders have a transparent view of progress. That transparency builds trust and reduces meeting churn.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
