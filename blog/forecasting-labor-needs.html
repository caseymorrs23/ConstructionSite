    <h2>Outputs that Convert to Durations</h2>
<p>Forecasting starts with outputs—units framed per day, walls set per hour, stairs per shift. We adjust for shear density, floor height, material handling, and weather windows. Those outputs roll up into durations that owners and lenders can trust.</p>
<p>With predictable durations, we can size crews to hit milestones without waste. It’s how we keep manpower steady and morale high.</p>
<h2>Flexing Without Chaos</h2>
<p>When the plan changes, we flex crews purposefully: a recovery squad to a critical zone, not a full team shuffle. This protects productivity and keeps safety controls intact.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
