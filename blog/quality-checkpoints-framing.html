    <h2>From Layout to Punch</h2>
<p>Quality starts with layout. Our crews confirm control lines, plate crown, and shear hold‑downs before wall build. We standardize fastening schedules and require photo verification on critical details. This reduces failures at shear and framing inspections, the two milestones that most often delay projects.</p>
<p>Door and window openings are laser-verified. For stair framing, we check cumulative rise and run to avoid finish rework. These small disciplines save days later.</p>
<h2>Documentation the GC Can Trust</h2>
<p>We maintain checklists for each floor and elevation. When a superintendent signs a checklist, it means measurements and photos exist. That package becomes part of the closeout record and protects everyone involved if a dispute arises.</p>
<p>Punch is still necessary, but good framing should make it short. We coordinate early with the drywall and siding trades so they do not inherit a problem that should have been solved in framing.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
