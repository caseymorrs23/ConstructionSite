      <p>Quality Control Checkpoints that Prevent Rework. As a production framing partner, we focus on the levers that move schedules without compromising safety or quality. We standardize layout, verify embeds and anchor locations early, and sequence crews so work faces stay fed. Our approach keeps cranes productive and bottlenecks out of critical path.</p>
<p>Pre‑construction matters as much as field speed. We clarify scope boundaries, confirm details with the GC and design team, and publish a short communication plan (RFIs, daily updates, constraints). With clean expectations, we avoid rework and give supers fewer surprises to manage.</p>
<p>Safety protects schedules. Daily briefs, task hazard analyses, and rigging reviews make the work predictable for crews and subs working around us. Better predictability equals better production. We pair that with QC checkpoints — layout, shear walls, openings, blocking — so small misses never grow into rework.</p>
<p>We design our manpower plans for continuous flow. Stair cores, corridors, balconies, and roofs each have a repeatable rhythm. When the team can repeat in a controlled way, cycle times tighten, and we get to early dry‑in faster for the GC and follow‑on trades.</p>
<p>Communication keeps the project team aligned. We align with supers on look‑ahead, material staging, and crane priorities, and we surface constraints early. When issues arise, we give clear options with schedule and cost impacts so decisions come quickly and work continues.</p>
<p>Quality isn’t an inspection at the end; it’s baked into how we frame. We check plumb, line, and square, protect panels and WRB from damage, and verify window and door openings against hardware schedules. This approach prevents punchlist churn and warranty call‑backs.</p>
<p>Finally, we measure. Production boards and simple metrics tell us where to help, not who to blame. We reinforce wins and fix friction fast, which is why GCs bring us back for the next building.</p>
