    <h2>Commercial Discipline, Residential Craft</h2>
<p>Custom homes benefit from the same discipline we bring to large jobs: clean layout, straight lines, and documented checkpoints. We add the craft that homeowners notice—tight miters, consistent reveals, and hardware that feels solid for decades.</p>
<p>For builders who manage multiple homes, our process scales. Schedules are predictable and punch lists stay short.</p>
<h2>Energy and Envelope</h2>
<p>Residential performance depends on proper WRB integration and air-sealing at openings. Our crews tie framing to envelope details so inspectors and homeowners see a home that performs as beautifully as it looks.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
