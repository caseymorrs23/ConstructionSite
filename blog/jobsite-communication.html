    <h2>Daily Briefs that Matter</h2>
<p>Five-minute morning briefs lock the plan: zones, deliveries, inspections, and safety notes. We end the day with a quick check against targets so leadership knows exactly where to focus tomorrow.</p>
<p>Clear communication reduces rework and protects both budget and schedule—owners notice when a job runs this way.</p>
<h2>Reporting Owners Can Use</h2>
<p>We publish simple visuals: elevation progress, units complete, and upcoming inspections. Stakeholders can see the job’s momentum at a glance, which builds confidence and speeds approvals.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
