    <h2>Why CLT is Different</h2>
<p>CLT panels arrive as precision components. That means tolerances are tighter and schedules can be faster—but only if rigging, staging, and sequencing are dialed. We coordinate with the manufacturer on panel packing order, lifting points, and protection so panels stay clean and installations stay on pace.</p>
<p>Our lift plans consider wind, fall protection anchorage, and exclusion zones. Crews are briefed daily on pick paths, communication protocols, and contingency actions. With heavy elements moving overhead, clarity is non‑negotiable.</p>
<h2>Rigging and Logistics</h2>
<p>We design rigging based on panel dimensions and hardware. Spreader bars, slings, and anchors are verified against manufacturer guidance and stamped where required. We align delivery cadence with crane capacity so panels do not idle on the ground where they risk damage.</p>
<p>Site logistics include protected laydown, panel edge guards, and weather covers. Working in the Pacific Northwest means we always have a water management plan—edges sealed, penetrations taped, and surfaces protected.</p>
<h2>Schedule, Tolerances, and Inspections</h2>
<p>Because CLT acts as structure and finish in many applications, inspections for alignment, fastening patterns, and firestopping are critical. We use checklists tied to panel drawings and record as‑built photos. These routines keep installation velocity high while assuring architects and owners that quality requirements are met.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
