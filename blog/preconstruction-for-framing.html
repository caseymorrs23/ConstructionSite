    <h2>Why Framing Input Needs to Start in Precon</h2>
<p>The cost and schedule of a large wood-framed project are set long before the first crew shows up. Early input from the framing contractor reduces rework, improves detailing, and lets everyone price with confidence. GQC reviews drawings for framing efficiency, hardware conflicts, and realistic sequencing so bids reflect the actual work and the schedule reflects the real path of production.</p>
<p>When we join preconstruction, our team flags high-risk details like tight shear-wall hold-down zones, mechanical chases cutting through framing, or window packages that don’t match rough openings. Clearing these items in precon prevents RFIs and change orders during production—protecting the GC’s contingency and the project’s timeline.</p>
<h2>What We Review and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Our preconstruction package includes layout assumptions, stud and joist standards, truss and LVL paths, and envelope tie-ins. We document crane and material-handling logistics so site utilization plans reflect real turning radiuses and staging. We verify that shop drawings and submittals align with field methods—avoiding last-minute redesign during subfloor or shear inspections.</p>
<p>By aligning the envelope early, we help the team close the building faster. That preserves schedule float and protects downstream trades. It is common for GCs to ask us to lead a rough-opening matrix that ties window types to WRB and flashing details—this single artifact reduces the most frequent envelope mistakes we see on multi-family.</p>
<h2>Pricing that Matches Production</h2>
<p>Bids that ignore production reality look inexpensive until the job starts. In precon we map crew sizes to durations, show assumptions for daily output, and identify logical handoffs to follow-on trades. That lets the GC publish a credible CPM schedule and set the right expectations with the owner.</p>
<p>The result is a bid that holds. When the team understands the method of work, there are fewer surprises and fewer claims. Owners appreciate this transparency and reward it with faster approvals and fewer design churn cycles.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
