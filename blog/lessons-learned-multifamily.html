    <h2>What We See Most Often</h2>
<p>Washington’s weather, topography, and permitting create unique constraints. We see the best outcomes where envelope decisions are locked early and site logistics are modeled before mobilization. The worst schedules come from late openings coordination and incomplete shop drawings.</p>
<p>Our lessons learned library informs every new job—details, durations, and manpower that have worked on buildings of similar scale.</p>
<h2>Owner Priorities and Turnover</h2>
<p>Owners want predictable turnover and clean common areas. We protect both by emphasizing dry‑in pace and stair/amenity framing. Delivering these spaces early lets other trades gain float without impacting the critical path.</p><p> GQC crews plan, communicate, and execute to protect schedule, safety, and quality.
