    <p>GQC delivers schedule‑first framing for large multi‑family, light commercial, and custom residential projects across Washington. Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. Early layout and scope reviews surface conflicts before they hit the field. Foremen carry current drawings, marked with QC ties for layout, shear, truss, and stairs. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. Daily start‑up briefs set the plan for the shift, coordinate deliveries and lifts, and flag safety or sequencing issues. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. Envelope coordination happens in parallel: WRB tie‑ins, flashing, and windows/doors receive checkpoints so finishes follow cleanly without call‑backs. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. Hardware and openings are verified for swing, backing, blocking, and rough sizes to make doors and specialties install smoothly. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. We coordinate with the GC and trades through short cycles: questions roll to RFIs immediately, updates get communicated back to crews at the next stand‑up. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. On multi‑family, repeatable unit types are batched for velocity; unique conditions get a focused layout walk before production runs. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. Safety is embedded: housekeeping, harness and ladder checks, and spotter rules around equipment reduce lost time and improve throughput. </p>

Our approach is practical and production‑oriented: preconstruction alignment, clean layout, daily briefs, QC checkpoints, and consistent closeout. That rhythm protects the schedule, reduces rework, and gives GCs and owners predictable outcomes. Closeout aims for first‑pass inspection: punch is grouped by area so painters, floor, and casework maintain momentum. </p>
